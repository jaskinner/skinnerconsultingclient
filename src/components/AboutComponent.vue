        <h2>Seasoned Full Stack Developer with a Rich Background in Data and UI/UX</h2>
        <p>
            I began my tech journey in database management and ETL, transitioning into front-end
            development and WordPress, where I worked with companies like Sensus and Lenovo. My move
            to backend development at Financial Risk Group marked a pivotal point, deepening my full
            stack development skills. In NYC, I leveraged my performing arts background for
            effective client communication and started a successful freelancing career before moving
            into a significant role as a ServiceNow Developer at CBS Corporation. At ServiceTrade, I
            collaborated on a B2B tool suite, further honing my collaborative development skills.
            Now, as a freelancer since April 2023, I specialize in empowering clients across various
            industries with robust and innovative tech solutions.
