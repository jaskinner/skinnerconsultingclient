            <h2>Seasoned Full Stack Developer with a Rich Background in Data and UI/UX</h2>
            <p>
                I began my tech journey in database management and ETL, transitioning into front-end
                development and WordPress, where I worked with companies like Sensus and Lenovo. My
                move to backend development at Financial Risk Group marked a pivotal point,
                deepening my full stack development skills. In NYC, I leveraged my performing arts
                background for effective client communication and started a successful freelancing
                career before moving into a significant role as a ServiceNow Developer at CBS
                Corporation. At ServiceTrade, I collaborated on a B2B tool suite, further honing my
                collaborative development skills. Now, as a freelancer since April 2023, I
                specialize in empowering clients across various industries with robust and
                innovative tech solutions.
